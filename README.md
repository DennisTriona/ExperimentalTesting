# ExperimentalTesting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A wonderful repository where you can do whatever the ***** you want and it won't cause any major issues. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Welcome*

This rep is made for creating TestProjects for experimental feature development and such. When creating
a new TestProject I suggest that you follow the steps in the following section: 

(to keep this rep clean, we should try to keep most feature experiments in separate projects)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Creating a NEW TestProject*

1. Create a new Branch in the GitHub-repository, named somewhat appropriately.  

2. Create a new Project in the 'ExperimentalTesting' folder, preferably with its own subfolder.

3. Add any and all appropriate file types to the .gitignorefile. 

4. Commit the new Branch with the initial "empty" project with a nice "NEW ... PROJECT!" Summary-label.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Maintaining your project* 

As a follow-up to the previous section, while working on a TestProject, either by yourself or in group.
Try to follow these guidelines: (This is an ever-expanding section)
 
# When Committing your content, the name convention should be: 	"PROJECT_NAME: your_summary" or
						  	        "PROJECT_NAME: angry_rant_bullshit" etc.

# Try to only commit and push stable versions of your projects, so clean out the bugs before
  committing. (If not told otherwise)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Detailed Committing/Pushing Conventions*
